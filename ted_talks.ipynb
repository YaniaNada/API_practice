              "  'description': \"Rebeca Hwang has spent a lifetime juggling identities -- Korean heritage, Argentinian upbringing, education in the United States -- and for a long time she had difficulty finding a place in the world to call home. Yet along with these challenges came a pivotal realization: that a diverse background is a distinct advantage in today's globalized world. In this personal talk, Hwang reveals the endless benefits of embracing our complex identities -- and shares her hopes for creating a world where identities aren't used to alienate but to bring people together instead.\",\n",

Before joining the business world, he was a platoon commander in Afghanistan, in charge of 36 Marines fighting the Taliban and maintaining a vital supply route through Helmand Province. He had to reconsider everything he knew about being a leader when he was forced to divide his platoon and give control over to other commanders. It was then Humphreys realized the surprising connection between this successful decentralized management model, and how we manage machine learning in business. His resulting leadership strategy offers three lessons on building a more effective team that every manager can learn from.',\n",

But David Deutsch believes that's all beside the point, because humans possess one unique skill: attaining knowledge. David Deutsch -- Oxford professor, father of quantum computing, recluse -- convinced Chris Anderson years ago to take over leadership of TED with his ideas about knowledge. In this mind-bending conversation, the two dive into his theory that the potential reach of knowledge is infinite. They explore how knowledge first developed, why it sets us apart and what all of these heady concepts really mean for our present and future. (Audio only)\",\n",

As a writer, Elizabeth Gilbert is notorious for placing her heart squarely on her sleeve. Her best-selling memoir \"Eat Pray Love\" was a sensation precisely because of her eloquent, open-hearted descriptions of fear, divorce and wanting everything life had to offer. When she spoke at TED back in 2009, she charmed the audience with her frank descriptions of what happened after the book became a runaway success and her lyrical ideas of the nature of creativity. Nearly ten years later, in this extraordinarily intimate conversation with Chris Anderson, she shares why openness, transparency and creativity are still central to her philosophy of life -- even when faced with moments of desperation and personal tragedy.

She took out a piece of paper, wrote \"Me Too\" across the top and laid out an action plan for a movement centered on the power of empathy between survivors. More than a decade later, she reflects on what has since become a global movement -- and makes a powerful call to dismantle the power and privilege that are building blocks of sexual violence. \"We owe future generations nothing less than a world free of sexual violence,\" she says. \"I believe we can build that world.\"',\n",
